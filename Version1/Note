@This Version includes the various list of Mask, Blur, GrayScale and Non-Maximum Suppression.
@Appliying step: 1. Turn on the Camera. 2. Capture Image. 3.Blur (or not) 4. Set the Mask. 5. Click Non max 

@Grayscale is the average method.
Gray = (R+G+B)/3

@Blur algorithm uses 5x5 Matrix and average method is used (not the Guassian filter).
1. Picked on the pixel of the image.
2. Get 5x5 Matrix Color values, including the picked pixel and surrounded pixels then find the total sum of each value of RGB.
3. Divide it by 25. Therefore, we can get the average color value of the pixel.
4. Set the color of the pixel of the picked pixel as the average of this.

@These are the matrix of Mask list
Non-mask default

| 0  -1  0|  | 0  -1  0|
| 0   0  0|  | 0   0  0|
Laplacian Mask set
| 0  1  0| | 0  -1   0|
| 1  4  1| | -1  4  -1|
| 0  1  0| | 0  -1   0|
#Remember when calculating the Mask set, it is not calculated as a Matrix multiply, it is directly multiplied with the color values.

@Non-Maximum Suppression
1. Picking one pixel of the image
2. Finding the 3x3 Matrix which includes the picked pixel.(You can changed the size of Matrix)
3. Saving all of the RGB values of pixels from 3x3 Matrix (in this case the gray scale is already applied, so I just picked the Blue value of pixel)
4. If the picked pixel's value is not the maximum in the Saved RGB values
-> Saving it in the black dot list.
5. After detectin all of the pixels, set the pixels, which was saved in the black dot list, as black color.
