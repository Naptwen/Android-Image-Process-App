I found the wrong algorithm in the Blur Algorithm from previews scrip.
I fixed it and I made a reduce process for changing the size of bitmap in Bitmap_to_Drawing.

And I changed the Non_Maximum_suppression function's algorithm as angular processing algorithm (by using gradient)
rather than coordinate matrix masking system.
